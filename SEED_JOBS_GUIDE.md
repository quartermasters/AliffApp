## Seeding Methods

### Option 1: Run Seed Script (Recommended for Local Development)

If you have a local PostgreSQL database running:

```bash
# Make sure DATABASE_URL is set in .env
npx tsx prisma/seeds/seed-job-postings.ts
```

### Option 2: API Route (Recommended for Production/Vercel)

After deploying to Vercel with database connected:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/admin/seed-jobs

# Or visit in browser and use a tool like Postman
POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/admin/seed-jobs
```

**Security Note:** In production, add authentication to this route!

### Option 3: Prisma Studio (Manual)

1. Open Prisma Studio:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

2. Navigate to `JobPosting` model

3. Manually create job postings using the data from `prisma/seeds/seed-job-postings.ts`

### Option 4: SQL Direct Insert (Advanced)

Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run the SQL generated by the seed script.

## Verification

After seeding, verify jobs appear correctly:

1. **Visit Careers Page**: https://your-app.vercel.app/careers
   - Should show all 9 jobs

3. **Database Check**:
   ```sql
   SELECT title, slug, salary, status, "publishedAt"
   FROM job_postings
   ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
   ```
