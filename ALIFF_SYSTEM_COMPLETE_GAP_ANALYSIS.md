## 7. 🎯 Prioritized Roadmap

### Priority 1: CRITICAL (Build First)

**1. Training System (Weeks 1-2)**
- Set up RAG system for knowledge retrieval
- Complete data collection pipeline
- Build role-based knowledge access
- **Why**: All other components need this

**2. Security & Filtering (Weeks 2-3)**
- Role authentication
- Output filtering
- Client data isolation
- **Why**: Must be in place before public-facing features

**3. ALIFF-OPS (SDL) Core (Weeks 4-8)**
- Document parsing
- Phase 1 Triage (automated extraction)
- Basic diagnosis workflow
- **Why**: Core value proposition, biggest differentiator

### Priority 2: HIGH VALUE (Build Next)

**4. ALIFF-SALES Completion (Weeks 9-10)**
- CRM integration
- Lead scoring
- Analytics dashboard
- **Why**: Immediate revenue impact

**5. ALIFF-CLIENT (Weeks 11-12)**
- Client portal
- Automated updates
- Support workflow
- **Why**: Scalability for client management

### Priority 3: OPTIMIZATION (Build Last)

**6. ALIFF-CEO (Weeks 13-14)**
- Business intelligence
- Win/loss analysis
- Strategic insights
- **Why**: Valuable but not blocking operations

**7. ALIFF-TRAINER (Weeks 15-16)**
- Training modules
- Onboarding automation
- **Why**: Nice-to-have, can be manual initially

---

## 8. 🚧 Blockers & Risks

### Technical Blockers

**1. Multi-AI API Access**
- **Issue**: Need API access to GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Grok
- **Impact**: Can't build ALIFF-OPS without multi-AI orchestration
- **Mitigation**: Start with GPT-4 + Claude, add others incrementally

**2. Vector Database for RAG**
- **Issue**: Need production-grade vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
- **Impact**: Can't implement role-based knowledge retrieval
- **Mitigation**: Use simple embedding search initially, migrate to vector DB later

**3. Document Parsing Accuracy**
- **Issue**: RFPs come in many formats (PDF, Word, scanned images)
- **Impact**: SDL accuracy depends on clean document parsing
- **Mitigation**: Manual review + correction pipeline initially

### Business Risks

**4. Strategy Leak Prevention**
- **Issue**: AI might accidentally reveal proprietary methods to competitors
- **Impact**: Loss of competitive advantage
- **Mitigation**: Multi-layer filtering + human review for sensitive queries

**5. Client Data Isolation**
- **Issue**: Agency A must never see Agency B's strategies/data
- **Impact**: Legal/trust issues if data leaks
- **Mitigation**: Database-level isolation + query filtering + audit logging

**6. Model Hallucinations**
- **Issue**: AI might generate incorrect diagnosis or recommendations
- **Impact**: Bad advice could lead to proposal losses
- **Mitigation**: Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions, confidence thresholds

### Resource Risks

**7. Development Capacity**
- **Issue**: 575 hours of development work
- **Impact**: 4+ months to complete full system
- **Mitigation**: Phased rollout, focus on Priority 1 first

**8. API Costs**
- **Issue**: Multi-AI orchestration could be expensive
- **Impact**: $1,000-2,000/month at scale
- **Mitigation**: Cost optimization (cheaper models for routine tasks)
