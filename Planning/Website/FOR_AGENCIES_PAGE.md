### Section 11: FAQ

**Headline**: "Your Questions. Answered."

**Key Questions**:

**Q: How does white-labeling actually work?**
A: Every deliverable includes your logo, your branding, your templates. Emails come from your domain. Your client portal (if enabled) uses your subdomain. Client sees only your agency name, never Aliff.

**Q: What if my client asks technical questions?**
A: We provide you with talking points. You can also route technical questions to us via your Agency Portal, and we'll draft responses for you to send under your name.

**Q: How do payment terms work?**
A: You pay per project after completion. No monthly fees, no platform fees. Net-30 terms available with credit card on file for security.

**Q: What's your quality guarantee?**
A: If deliverable doesn't meet your standards, we revise until it does. If still unsatisfactory, we replace the provider and redo the work at no charge.

**Q: Can I try it before committing?**
A: Yes. Schedule a demo, and we can do a pilot project at discounted rate to prove value.

**Q: What services can be white-labeled?**
A: All of them. GOVCON, SLED, Writing, IT Services. 4 categories, 24 total service types.

**Q: How fast is typical turnaround?**
A: 5-7 days for proposals and writing. 4-12 weeks for IT projects. Rush available.

**Q: Do you ever contact my clients directly?**
A: Never. You maintain 100% client relationship control. We're invisible.
