## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 What Is This Dashboard?

The **Aliff Services Dashboard** is NOT just a candidate portal—it's the **central nervous system** managing an AI-orchestrated professional services delivery platform. It coordinates:

- **Complete project lifecycle**: RFP intake → SDL analysis → Team assembly → Delivery → Quality gates → Win/loss tracking
- **Multi-stakeholder operations**: Super Admin, Clients (B2B/B2C), Providers (anonymized), Candidates, AI systems
- **AI orchestration**: 34-task SDL, multi-AI consensus (GPT-4 + Claude + Gemini), automated quality gates
- **Resource management**: Provider matching, time tracking, fraud detection, payroll
- **Financial operations**: Client invoicing, provider payments, profit margin analysis
- **Business intelligence**: 22% win rate tracking, revenue analytics, operational efficiency

###

 1.2 The Real Plan (500 Words)

**The Central Operating System**

The **Aliff Services Dashboard** is the central nervous system managing the entire AI-orchestrated professional services business—from RFP intake through project delivery, quality control, talent management, and financial operations.

**What It Actually Manages:**

**1. Complete Project Lifecycle (12 Stages)**
Client Intake → SDL Analysis → Strategic Intel → Team Assembly → Execution → AI Validation (Pink Gate) → Expert Review (Red Gate) → Client Approval (Gold Gate) → Submission → Win/Loss Tracking

Every project flows through this pipeline with real-time status tracking, automated AI orchestration across 34 SDL tasks, and multi-stakeholder coordination (clients never see providers, providers never see client names).

**2. Multi-Stakeholder Operations**

**Super Admin Portal** (Operations Engine):
- Kanban project pipeline with win probability, contract value, deadlines
- SDL task queue monitoring (34 tasks × N projects)
- Split decision escalations (when AI consensus <60%)
- Quality gate queues (Pink/Red/Gold approval workflows)
- Provider assignment interface with CV Bank semantic search
- Time entry fraud detection (activity %, idle time, screenshots)
- Financial dashboard (revenue, payroll, profit margins)
- Business intelligence (22% win rate tracking, client satisfaction, operational efficiency)

**Client Portal** (View-Only Experience):
- Project progress tracking (anonymized—no provider visibility)
- Deliverable review and revision requests
- SDL-generated win probability scores
- Document access and communication
- Agency-specific: Multi-project dashboard, volume analytics, white-label branding

**Team Portal** (Anonymized Work Environment):
- Codename-based assignments ("Operation Phoenix"—not "ABC Agency")
- Deliverable upload with quality feedback
- Time tracking integration (Time Doctor/Hubstaff)
- Performance scores and payment tracking
- Zero client name exposure (complete operational security)

**Candidate Portal** (Recruitment Pipeline):
- Real-time application status with pipeline visualization
- Fit score display (87% match with skills breakdown)
- Embedded AI interview interface (15-min chat)
- Multi-AI evaluation results (GPT-4/Claude/Gemini consensus)
- CV Bank profile management (50+ fields, dual photos)

**3. AI Orchestration at Scale**

**ALIFF-RECRUITER**: Auto-matches CV Bank to project needs, posts jobs if no match, conducts 100% AI interviews, creates validated provider profiles

**SDL (Solicitation Diagnosis Lab)**: Executes 34 tasks across 3 phases (Triage → Strategic Intel → Win Strategy), generates win probability (0-100%), complexity scoring (1-10), and team assembly plans

**Multi-AI Consensus**: Every critical decision validated by GPT-4 + Claude + Gemini with automatic escalation when agreement <60%

**Quality Gates**: Pink (AI validation—compliance, hallucinations, grammar) → Red (3 expert reviews—strategy, differentiation, authenticity) → Gold (client approval)

**4. Financial & Performance Operations**

**Revenue Management**: Project-based pricing (no subscriptions), volume discounts for B2B agencies (70-90% revenue), client invoicing automation, payment tracking

**Provider Payroll**: Bi-weekly PKR payments offshore, Net-15 USD for US providers, fraud detection via activity monitoring, performance-based bonuses (5-star = +$500, win bonus = 10% profit share)

**Business Intelligence**: Real-time KPIs (active projects, win rate, revenue, utilization, quality scores), forecasting (pipeline value × win probability), provider leaderboards, client satisfaction NPS, operational efficiency metrics

**5. The Data Model**

Each **Project** tracks: codename, client (hidden from team), contract value, deadline, SDL win probability, complexity score, current stage, quality score, team assignments, deliverables, time entries, quality gate status

Each **Provider** tracks: projects completed, quality scores, on-time rate, client satisfaction, activity %, hourly rate, fraud flags, earnings, performance trend

Each **Candidate** tracks: application status, fit score, interview transcript, multi-AI scores, skills validation, CV Bank profile (50+ fields), matched opportunities

**The Vision**: This isn't a CRM—it's an **AI-powered service delivery orchestration platform** coordinating humans + AI systems to achieve 22% win rates (5.5x industry baseline) through strategic human intelligence validated and accelerated by multi-AI consensus across 34 discrete tasks per project.

## 11. RBAC & Authentication System

### 11.1 Role-Based Access Control Architecture

**4 Primary Roles + Granular Permissions:**

```
SUPER_ADMIN (God Mode - Full Access)
    ↓
CLIENT (View-Only + Feedback Submission)
    ↓
TEAM_PROVIDER (Anonymized Execution + Deliverables)
    ↓
CANDIDATE (Application Tracking Only)
```

### 11.2 Permission Model

```typescript
enum Permission {
  // Projects
  PROJECT_CREATE
  PROJECT_VIEW_ALL
  PROJECT_VIEW_ASSIGNED
  PROJECT_EDIT
  PROJECT_DELETE

  // SDL
  SDL_VIEW
  SDL_EXECUTE
  SDL_VALIDATE

  // Providers
  PROVIDER_MANAGE
  PROVIDER_ASSIGN
  PROVIDER_VIEW_PERFORMANCE

  // Clients
  CLIENT_MANAGE
  CLIENT_VIEW_PROJECTS

  // Quality Gates
  GATE_PINK_APPROVE
  GATE_RED_APPROVE
  GATE_GOLD_APPROVE

  // Financial
  FINANCE_VIEW
  PAYROLL_PROCESS
  INVOICE_CREATE

  // Analytics
  ANALYTICS_VIEW_ALL
  ANALYTICS_VIEW_OWN
}
```

### 11.3 User Model & Database Schema

```typescript
model User {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  email             String   @unique
  password          String   // Hashed with bcrypt
  role              UserRole
  status            UserStatus // ACTIVE, PENDING, SUSPENDED

  // Polymorphic relations
  clientProfile     Client?
  providerProfile   Candidate?
  adminProfile      Admin?

  // Session management
  sessions          Session[]

  // Audit trail
  lastLoginAt       DateTime?
  lastLoginIp       String?
  loginCount        Int      @default(0)

  createdAt         DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime @updatedAt
}

enum UserRole {
  SUPER_ADMIN
  CLIENT
  TEAM_PROVIDER
  CANDIDATE
}

enum UserStatus {
  ACTIVE
  PENDING      // Awaiting admin approval
  SUSPENDED    // Temporarily disabled
  ARCHIVED     // Permanently disabled
}

model Session {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId       String
  token        String   @unique
  expiresAt    DateTime
  ipAddress    String?
  userAgent    String?

  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())

  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model AuditLog {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId       String
  action       String   // "PROJECT_CREATE", "PROVIDER_ASSIGN", etc.
  resource     String   // "Project", "Candidate", etc.
  resourceId   String?
  metadata     Json?    // Additional context
  ipAddress    String?

  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
}
```

### 11.4 Authentication Flow

**Entry Points on Marketing Page:**

```
Homepage (/)
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Sign Up] → Role Selection                 │
│  [Login]   → Credential Entry               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Sign Up Flow (Role-Based):**

**Step 1: Choose Your Path** (Interactive Cards)
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">
  <Card onClick={() => selectRole('CLIENT')}>
    <Icon>🎯</Icon>
    <h3>I'm a Client</h3>
    <p>Submit RFPs, track projects</p>
  </Card>

  <Card onClick={() => selectRole('PROVIDER')}>
    <Icon>👤</Icon>
    <h3>I'm a Provider</h3>
    <p>Join talent pool, work on projects</p>
  </Card>

  <Card onClick={() => selectRole('CANDIDATE')}>
    <Icon>💼</Icon>
    <h3>I'm Applying</h3>
    <p>Browse jobs, submit applications</p>
  </Card>

  <Card onClick={() => window.location.href = '/auth/admin'}>
    <Icon>🔐</Icon>
    <h3>Admin Login</h3>
    <p>Internal access only</p>
  </Card>
</div>
```

**Step 2: Registration Forms (Role-Specific)**

**Client Signup** (`/auth/signup/client`):
```typescript
interface ClientSignupForm {
  // Company Info
  companyName: string
  industry: string
  clientType: 'AGENCY' | 'DIRECT'

  // Contact
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
  phone: string
  password: string

  // Verification
  emailVerified: boolean // Email verification required
  adminApproved: boolean // Default: false (PENDING status)
}
```

**Provider Signup** → Redirects to `/careers`:
- Goes through full ALIFF-RECRUITER application flow
- Account auto-created upon VALIDATED status
- Seamless transition from applicant → provider

**Candidate Signup** → Minimal:
```typescript
interface CandidateSignupForm {
  email: string
  password: string
  // Account created during job application
}
```

### 11.5 Login System

**Unified Login** (`/auth/login`):
```tsx
<form onSubmit={handleLogin}>
  <Input
    type="email"
    placeholder="Email"
    required
  />
  <Input
    type="password"
    placeholder="Password"
    required
  />
  <Button type="submit">Sign In</Button>

  <Link href="/auth/forgot-password">
    Forgot password?
  </Link>
</form>
```

**Smart Redirect Logic** (Based on Role):
```typescript
async function handleLogin(credentials: LoginCredentials) {
  const user = await signIn(credentials)

  switch (user.role) {
    case 'SUPER_ADMIN':
      redirect('/admin/dashboard')
      break
    case 'CLIENT':
      redirect('/client/dashboard')
      break
    case 'TEAM_PROVIDER':
      redirect('/team/dashboard')
      break
    case 'CANDIDATE':
      redirect('/candidate/dashboard')
      break
  }
}
```

### 11.6 Modern UX Features

**Dynamic Navigation** (Menu items based on permissions):
```tsx
<nav>
  {hasPermission('PROJECT_VIEW_ALL') && (
    <NavItem href="/admin/projects">Projects</NavItem>
  )}
  {hasPermission('SDL_VIEW') && (
    <NavItem href="/admin/sdl">SDL Queue</NavItem>
  )}
  {hasPermission('ANALYTICS_VIEW_ALL') && (
    <NavItem href="/admin/analytics">Analytics</NavItem>
  )}
</nav>
```

**Real-Time Permission Sync** (via SSE):
```typescript
// When admin changes user role/permissions
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/auth/permissions/stream')

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const { permissions, role } = JSON.parse(event.data)
  updateUserSession({ permissions, role })
  revalidateNavigation()
}
```

**Granular Field-Level Security**:
```typescript
// Hide sensitive data based on role
<div>
  {user.role === 'SUPER_ADMIN' && (
    <p>Client: {project.clientName}</p> // Hidden from TEAM_PROVIDER
  )}

  {user.role === 'TEAM_PROVIDER' && (
    <p>Project: {project.projectCodename}</p> // Anonymized
  )}

  {hasPermission('FINANCE_VIEW') && (
    <p>Rate: PKR {provider.hourlyRatePKR}</p> // Hidden from others
  )}
</div>
```

**Interactive Role Switcher** (Super Admin Testing):
```tsx
{user.role === 'SUPER_ADMIN' && (
  <RoleSwitcher>
    <option value="SUPER_ADMIN">View as: Super Admin</option>
    <option value="CLIENT">View as: Client</option>
    <option value="TEAM_PROVIDER">View as: Provider</option>
    <option value="CANDIDATE">View as: Candidate</option>
  </RoleSwitcher>
)}
```

    if (!session || session.user.role !== 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/auth/login', request.url))
    }
  }

  // Protect client routes
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/client')) {
    if (!session || session.user.role !== 'CLIENT') {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/auth/login', request.url))
    }
  }

  // Protect team routes
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/team')) {
    if (!session || session.user.role !== 'TEAM_PROVIDER') {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/auth/login', request.url))
    }
  }

  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/admin/:path*', '/client/:path*', '/team/:path*', '/candidate/:path*']
}
```

**Audit Trail:**
```typescript
// Log every action
async function logAudit(params: {
  userId: string
  action: string
  resource: string
  resourceId?: string
  metadata?: any
  ipAddress?: string
}) {
  await prisma.auditLog.create({
    data: {
      userId: params.userId,
      action: params.action,
      resource: params.resource,
      resourceId: params.resourceId,
      metadata: params.metadata,
      ipAddress: params.ipAddress,
      createdAt: new Date(),
    }
  })
}

// Usage
await logAudit({
  userId: session.user.id,
  action: 'PROJECT_CREATE',
  resource: 'Project',
