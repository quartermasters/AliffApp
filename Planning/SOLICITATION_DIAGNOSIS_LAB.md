# Solicitation Diagnosis Lab - Control Center Concept

**Status:** Brainstorming / Concept Phase
**Purpose:** Structured diagnosis process before solution design

---

## Core Principle

Structured diagnosis before solution design. Like a medical lab that runs specific tests in specific sequence before prescription.

**Key Insight:** Solicitations describe symptoms, not root causes. RFP states requirements, but real pain points remain hidden. GenAI reads what's written. Humans diagnose what's unstated.

---

## Three-Phase Framework

### Phase 1: TRIAGE (AI-Led, Human-Supervised)
- AI extracts all RFP requirements, deadlines, evaluation criteria, incumbent info
- AI identifies solicitation type (new contract, re-compete, IDIQ, etc.)
- AI flags complexity indicators (past performance requirements, security clearances, teaming needs)
- **Human Decision Point:** Senior strategist reviews triage, assigns diagnosis depth level (Standard/Complex/Strategic)

### Phase 2: DIAGNOSIS (Human-Led, AI-Assisted)

**Diagnosis Checklist (Mandatory Investigation):**
1. **Incumbent Analysis** - Why is contract being re-competed? Performance issues? Price? Politics?
2. **Timeline Constraints** - What operational realities affect transition? (Example: Security clearance timelines)
3. **Unstated Requirements** - What do they need but can't write in RFP?
4. **Agency Culture** - Risk-averse or innovation-friendly? Relationship-driven or process-driven?
5. **Evaluation Priorities** - Do they really weight technical highest or is past performance the real filter?
6. **Budget Reality** - Is their estimate realistic or are they price-fishing?

**AI Support Tasks:**
- Research agency recent awards, protests, leadership changes
- Analyze incumbent's past performance ratings
- Extract insights from similar solicitations
- Build agency profile from historical data

**Human Expert Tasks:**
- Engage with contracting officer (where permitted)
- Interview client about relationship with agency
- Apply pattern recognition from similar situations
- Identify hidden constraints
- Document diagnosis findings in structured format

### Phase 3: SOLUTION DESIGN (Collaborative)
- Human strategist defines win themes based on diagnosis
- AI generates compliant technical solution
- Human validates solution addresses diagnosed pain points (not just stated requirements)

---

## Control Center Rules

**Rule 1:** No solution design starts before diagnosis complete
**Rule 2:** All diagnosis findings must answer "Why is agency doing this procurement NOW?"
**Rule 3:** If diagnosis reveals pain point, solution must explicitly address it
**Rule 4:** AI cannot override human diagnosis conclusions
**Rule 5:** Every solicitation gets minimum 3 diagnosis questions answered

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

### AI Role:
- Data extraction and research
- Pattern identification
- Compliance checking
- Solution drafting
- **Cannot:** Make strategic decisions, engage stakeholders, diagnose unstated needs

### Human Strategist Role:
- Diagnosis leadership
- Stakeholder engagement
- Strategic decision-making
- Win theme development
- **Cannot:** Skip diagnosis phase for speed

---

## Quality Gates

**Gate 1:** Triage completeness check before diagnosis starts
**Gate 2:** Diagnosis validation - minimum questions answered
**Gate 3:** Solution-diagnosis alignment check before drafting
**Gate 4:** Final compliance + strategic alignment review

---

## Knowledge Capture

Every diagnosis builds institutional knowledge. Example: "Security clearance timelines drive incumbent preference" becomes searchable case study for future similar solicitations.

## Real-Life Example: US Embassy Language Instructors

**What Solicitation Said:**
"Provide qualified English/Urdu instructors meeting education, experience, security criteria"

**What GenAI Would Do:**
- Parse requirements
- Generate compliant response
- Propose hiring new qualified instructors
- Miss actual problem
- Lose contract

**What Human Diagnosis Discovered:**
- Current instructors already security cleared
- New hires require 7-8 months for clearance
- Agency cannot afford operational gap
- Real need: Keep current instructors, change contractor
- **Win strategy:** Hire existing instructors, ensure continuity

**This Cannot Be Coded:** Requires human engagement, pattern recognition, understanding agency dynamics, reading unstated constraints.

## For B2B Agencies

Agencies access the Lab for their client solicitations. They input RFP, our Lab runs diagnosis, they get strategic recommendations + compliant draft.

---

## Competitive Advantage

This systematic approach prevents "rush to proposal" mistake. Forces diagnosis discipline every time.

**Core Message:** Compliance gets you in the door. Diagnosis wins the contract.

---

## Next Steps (To Expand Later)

- Define detailed workflow diagrams
- Create diagnosis templates by solicitation type
- Build knowledge base structure
- Design quality gate checkpoints
- Develop B2B agency access interface
- Create training protocols for diagnosis team
