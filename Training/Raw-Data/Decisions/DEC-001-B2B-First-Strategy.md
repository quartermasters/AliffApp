**Aliff Roles with Access:** [SALES, OPS, CEO]
**Sensitivity Level:** secret

## Situation

**What triggered this decision?**
Revenue analysis shows 70-90% of business comes from B2B channel (agencies reselling white-labeled services), not direct B2C contractors. Original planning documents focused primarily on B2C approach, not reflecting actual business model.

---

## Options Considered

**Option 1:** Equal Focus on B2C and B2B
- **Pros:**
  - Serves both markets
  - Diversified revenue
  - Direct client relationships
- **Cons:**
  - Doesn't match actual 70-90% B2B revenue reality
  - Under-invests in primary revenue driver
  - Marketing spend inefficiently allocated

**Option 2:** B2B-First Strategy (70-90% focus)
- **Pros:**
  - Aligns with actual revenue distribution
  - Invests in highest-ROI channel
  - Scales faster (agencies bring multiple clients)
  - Higher volume per customer
- **Cons:**
  - May underserve B2C market
  - Dependent on agency relationships
  - White-label reduces brand visibility

**Option 3:** B2B-Only, Eliminate B2C
- **Pros:**
  - Complete focus on primary revenue
  - Simplified operations
- **Cons:**
  - Loses 10-30% revenue
  - Eliminates brand-building from direct clients
  - Risky dependency on single channel

## Decision Made

**The Decision:**
**B2B-First Strategy:** Platform, marketing, and operations optimized for 70-90% B2B revenue while maintaining B2C as secondary channel.

**Rationale:**
- Actual business performance shows B2B is primary revenue driver
- Agencies provide volume, scalability, and consistent pipeline
- B2C maintains brand presence and provides direct market feedback
- White-label capability is competitive advantage for agency partnerships

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain quality for both B2B and B2C (agencies demand superior quality)
- Cannot publicly reveal B2B dominance (protects competitive positioning)
- Must keep same login for contractors and agencies (simplicity)

**Assumptions:**
- B2B agencies value scalable capacity without hiring
- Volume discounts (15-25%) maintain healthy margins
- White-label delivery maintains agency client relationships
- Direct B2C provides market insights and brand building

---

## Implementation Rules

**Rule 1: Platform Priority**
- **IF:** Feature request from B2B agency
- **THEN:** Prioritize over B2C feature requests (unless critical bug)

**Rule 2: Volume Pricing**
- **IF:** Agency client with 5-10 projects
- **THEN:** 15% volume discount
- **IF:** Agency client with 10-20 projects
- **THEN:** 20% volume discount
- **IF:** Agency client with 20+ projects
- **THEN:** 25% volume discount

**Rule 3: White-Label Delivery**
- **IF:** B2B agency client
- **THEN:** All deliverables white-labeled, no Aliff branding exposed to end client

**Rule 4: Payment Terms**
- **IF:** B2B agency with established relationship + credit card on file
- **THEN:** Net-30 terms available
- **IF:** New agency or no card on file
- **THEN:** Payment required before delivery

**Rule 5: Marketing Budget Allocation**
- **IF:** Marketing spend decisions
- **THEN:** 70% to B2B channels (agency outreach, partnerships), 30% to B2C (SEO, content, brand)

---

## Exception Handling

**Exception 1:** High-value B2C client (large contractor with ongoing needs)
- **How to handle:** Treat as B2B equivalent in terms of priority and account management

**Exception 2:** Agency requesting discount beyond 25%
- **How to handle:** Escalate to CEO for custom negotiation, only if volume justifies

**Exception 3:** Direct B2C client discovers we work with their agency
- **How to handle:** Maintain confidentiality, neither confirm nor deny agency relationships

---

## Success Metrics

**How to measure if this decision was correct:**
- B2B revenue growth rate vs. B2C
- Agency retention rate (target: >85%)
- Average project volume per agency (target: increasing)
- Agency referrals to other agencies
- Gross margin on B2B vs. B2C (should be comparable despite discounts due to volume efficiency)

---

**What Should NEVER Be Revealed Publicly:**
- 70-90% B2B revenue percentage
- Specific volume discount percentages (15%, 20%, 25%)
- Net-30 payment requires credit card on file (payment protection strategy)
- Agency client names or relationships
- White-label delivery specifics

**What CAN Be Said Publicly:**
- "We partner with leading GOVCON agencies"
- "Volume discounts available for agencies"
- "White-label solutions for agencies"
- "Superior services at lower rates"
- "Pay per project, no platform fees"
