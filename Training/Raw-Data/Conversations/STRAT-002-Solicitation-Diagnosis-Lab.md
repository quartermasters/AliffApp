# Strategic Discussion: Solicitation Diagnosis Lab

**ID:** STRAT-002
**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Topic:** Creating Control Center for Diagnosis Process

**Aliff Roles with Access:** [OPS, TRAINER, CEO]
**Sensitivity Level:** proprietary

## Context

**Situation:**
Need to systematize the solicitation diagnosis process to ensure every project benefits from strategic analysis before solution design. Create "Diagnosis Lab" as control center that sets rules, roles, tasks, and processes for both AI and human team.

---

## Discussion

**Main Question/Topic:**
How do we create a structured, repeatable diagnosis process that prevents "rush to proposal" mistake and ensures diagnosis discipline every time?

**Key Points Raised:**
1. **Medical Lab Analogy:** Like diagnostic lab that runs specific tests in specific sequence before prescription
2. **Three-Phase Framework:** Triage (AI-led) → Diagnosis (Human-led) → Solution Design (Collaborative)
3. **Mandatory Diagnosis Checklist:** Every solicitation must answer minimum diagnostic questions
4. **Quality Gates:** No advancement to next phase without completing current phase
5. **Knowledge Capture:** Every diagnosis builds institutional knowledge for future pattern recognition
6. **B2B Application:** Agencies access Lab for their client solicitations

**Strategic Reasoning:**
Systematic diagnosis process becomes competitive moat. Competitors skip diagnosis and rush to compliance response. We enforce diagnosis discipline that discovers unstated requirements and creates differentiated win strategies.

## Insights & Learnings

**Insight 1:**
- **Insight:** "No solution design starts before diagnosis complete" rule prevents most common mistake (rushing to write proposal before understanding real problem)
- **Application:** Hard-coded gate in workflow - system won't allow Phase 3 until Phase 2 validated

**Insight 2:**
- **Insight:** Diagnosis requires answering "Why is agency doing this procurement NOW?" - timing reveals unstated drivers
- **Application:** Mandatory question in every diagnosis checklist

**Insight 3:**
- **Insight:** AI excels at data extraction and pattern identification (Triage) but cannot make strategic diagnosis conclusions
- **Application:** Clear role division - AI supports, humans diagnose, AI cannot override human conclusions

**Insight 4:**
- **Insight:** Every diagnosis creates reusable patterns (e.g., "security clearance timeline pattern")
- **Application:** Knowledge capture system that makes institutional knowledge searchable for future solicitations

**Insight 5:**
- **Insight:** For B2B agencies, providing Diagnosis Lab access differentiates us from pure execution vendors
- **Application:** Agency dashboard includes Lab access for their client RFPs

## Decisions Made

**Decision 1:** Three-Phase Mandatory Framework
- **Rationale:** Structured process ensures diagnosis never skipped, even under time pressure
- **Impact:** All projects follow Triage → Diagnosis → Solution with quality gates between phases

**Decision 2:** Minimum 3 Diagnostic Questions Required
- **Rationale:** Forces investigation beyond surface-level RFP reading
- **Impact:** System validates diagnosis completeness before allowing solution phase

**Decision 3:** Human-Only Strategic Decisions
- **Rationale:** AI cannot diagnose unstated requirements or make strategic conclusions
- **Impact:** AI supports with data/research, human strategist owns diagnosis conclusions

**Decision 4:** Knowledge Capture After Every Diagnosis
- **Rationale:** Institutional learning compounds with every project
- **Impact:** Diagnosis findings structured and stored as searchable case studies

**Decision 5:** Agency Lab Access for B2B Clients
- **Rationale:** Strategic diagnosis access justifies premium positioning vs. commodity vendors
- **Impact:** Agencies input their clients' RFPs, receive diagnosis + compliant draft
